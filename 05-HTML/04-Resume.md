# HTML Resume

Using MicroTrain's preferred [resume template](../img/ResumeTemplate.pdf) as a model create, an HTML resume. This template has been preloaded with skills you will learn in this course. For now, do not worry about centering the text, columns and left/right justifications. We will deal with all of that in CSS. We will build a top-down version of your resume. Starting with your name in an ```h1``` element. You might consider wrapping your contact information in a ```div``` element and using HTML Entities, DEC or Hex values.

>**Reminder:** This will be on the public web, do not add any details you do not want to have posted to the web. You might consider showing only your city and links to LinkedIn and GitHub

```html
<h1>First Name Last Name</h1>
<div>
  <a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>
  &#x25CF;
  Some City, IL
</div>
```

You will follow that up with your desired job title in an ```h2```, then a paragraph ```p``` containing a brief summary, then a list ```ul``` of one or two highlights. Core Competencies is an ```h3``` followed by two bulleted list ```ul``` (just keep them stacked for now). Certifications / Technical Proficiencies will be an ```h2``` followed by another bulleted list (CSS will make this no look like a list). Professional Experience is back to an ```h2``` and each job starts with an ```h3```. From here try to figure out those elements for yourself.

## Lab - HTML Resume

Create an HTML version of your resume for your GitHub Pages site. Commit your changes and push them to main.

## Lab 2 - Semantic Meaning

Use HTML5 sectioning elements such as ```main``` and ```section``` to segment your resume into logical sections. This will help better communicate the structure of your resume and provide additional support for CSS.
* Wrap the entire resume in ```main```.
  * You may choose to wrap the resume in an ```article``` element and place that inside of the ```main``` element.
* Start a ```section``` before an ```h*``` end the section before the next ```h*``` element of the same level.
